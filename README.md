# Desktop app to learn german made in python
In this personal project I made a desktop app in python using tkinter to learn german by doing dictation exercises. The program enables you to upload a .txt file
that contains phrases in german, and you have to listen to them and write them in the input section in order to check they are right. You can also create a new lesson
and save it to study later on, and in the user inferface you can see some metrics about your performance and the elapsed time.
